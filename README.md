# 🛒 Retail Radar: Forecasting Sales with Predictive Analytics

This project provides a data-driven solution for retail sales forecasting using machine learning. It focuses on building accurate predictive models using historical data to help retailers make informed inventory and sales decisions.

Using regression-based algorithms like **XGBoost Regressor** and **Random Forest Regressor**, the notebook walks through the end-to-end data science pipeline: from data preprocessing and exploratory analysis to model training and evaluation.
